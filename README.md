- 👋 Hi, I’m @Stasi-Goreng
- 👀 I'm interested in all kinds of coding projects related to ML/AI, automation projects for embedded systems (like the Raspberry Pi) and anything else that's data-driven.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python for ML/AI and I work on a travel blog website using HTML, CSS and JS (farovanture.com).
- 💞️ I'm open to working on any projects with other people. I'm happy to gain as much coding experience as possible. :)
- I don't have any professional IT experience. I come from a medical background and my goal is to eventually develop AI and machine learning projects in medicine.
